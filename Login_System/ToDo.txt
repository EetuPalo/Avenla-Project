TODO:

//-----------------GENERAL-------------------------//
/---------Low priority & ongoing work-------------/
- A ton of testing.
- Comments
- Clean up code
- Clean UI
- Add authorization to where it makes sense
- Make sure there's no way a user/admin can break the application
	- Make sure the last admin account cant be removed
	- Make sure roles user and admin can't be removed
	- Make sure removal of anything else doesn't break anything
/-------------------------------------------------/
- Add search feature to some places (mostly done, improve search in userskills (maybe replace with a calendar)) !
- Delete confirmations to where it's useful to have !!
- Some sort of a "Mass edit" system for AppUsers (only usable by admins)? !
	- This could possibly be expanded to other menus as well
- Remove the register button, accounts should be added by the admin
- We might want to hide some unneccessary details pages

//-----------COURSES----------//
- WYSIWYG HTML Editor for Course Description? !
- Fix the redirects !!
- Improve the user experience !!
	- Setting a course to completed
	- Joining

//---------USERSKILLS---------//
- Add more useful info to the SkillList as it's now the "overview" page of the user !! (mostly done)
	- Make sure it works properly 
- Clean the SkillList action !!!

//---------SKILLGOALS---------//

//-----------GROUPS-----------//
- Fix redirects
- Statistics: !!
	- Graphs (fml)
	- add any ideas here
	- When there is only one skill set, line 43 in the Statistics.cshtml throws an exception
		- KINDA FIXED

//---------CERTIFICATES---------//
- Bug fixes and testing
- User should choose when he got the certificate instead of it being the date whent the user added the certificate to his account
- Improve the editing of certificates (edit should also automatically change the certificate name of existing entries as well)

DONE:
- //Deleting a group should delete every skillgoal and member association of that group !
- //Adding group memeber should be handled via a multiple selection list of users, not a dropdown (because we want to add many users at once) !!!
- //Adding users when creating a group (show list of users with checkboxes next to them)
- //Show skillgoal creation when creating a new group
- //Editing of goals for admins
- //Handle duplicate skill name on one form
- //SkillCourses are listed somewhere
- //Delete role feature
- //Maybe change the refresh button in the skillgoals to be automatic instead (needs javascript?)
- //Add action result messages to all the views (mostly done)
- //Improve the graphs
- //A Better way to view the progression of skills.
- //Admins should be able to add new accounts from their account. The View exists already, but nothing has been implemented.
- //When trying to access stuff youre not authorized for, the wrong (microsoft template) login page is show.
- //Possibly a way to separate the user's self-assesment from the assesment made by the admin [IMPLEMENTED WITH A SIMPLE STRING VALUE THAT IS DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE]
- //Limit the SkillLevel selection to 0-5
- //User's roles should be edited from the user profile.
- //Fix the SkillLevel 0 not registering
- //Better skill evaluation form (all skills on one form, different forms for different user groups) (Eetu)
- //Creating, editing, setting user groups for admins
- //Authorization fixes
- //Specific SkillLevel goals for each user group. Need to be displayed somehow to the users who are part of that group.
- //Editing skill goals should preserve the old version of the goal. (Similar "view by date" as in userskills)
- //User Groups (Parviz)
- //Remove "change password" from admin (kinda implemented, the code needs refactoring and maybe the whole thing could be more logical)
- //Graphs to display skill progression (Parviz)
- //Fix redirects in edit user (and refactor the whole thing)
- //Admins should edit the forms for each user group (can probably reuse code from user role editing)
- //This could maybe be implemented so that IF skillgoal is set to 0, the user group doesn't need to see it in the userskills form.
- //WHen registering, remove non letter non number characters so the invalidusername warning is not thrown preventing user from being created
- //Fix the "My Skills" button in the layout
- //UserSkills delete function needs to delete the whole form.
- //Edit view of userskills should allow the editing of them all on the same form (get the right enties by date and userid)
- //Impement this with a new EditForm-action. Admins should retain the ability to edit individual skills in a form
- //Editing of Skill names should update database entries with the new name
- //User employment status: Are they an active emoployee at Avenla, are they on holiday, or something else?
- //Course location?
- //Delete skillgoals of certain date
- //UserSkills switch listbydate and skilllist around
	- The current skill level needs to be easily seen
- //How to handle skill forms for users who are in multiple groups? (Mostly implemented, needs testing)
	- Deal with cases where two different groups (user is part of) has set goals for the same skill
- //Listing if user has completed a particular course (probably should be visible both in Course page, and somewhere in user profile (details/courses maybe)) !!
- //Date when course has been completed. !!
- //Users can enroll to courses
- //Improve the group creation UI !
- //It's now a 3-step process, add indicators showing that !
- //Improve the tempdata showing the date at the top of the page (seems to be mostly working) !
- //Later we might want to add multi day courses (eg. user has completed day 1 of course but not day 2) !!
- //Statistics
	- //Comparing the skill levels of group members to the skill goals set for the group
	- //SkillGoal of a specific skill vs the average of all group members (if unevaluated, treat it as 0)
- //Fix the crash when user hasn't yet evaluated any skills and tries to access their skills page
- //Implement certificates
	- //At least (id), name, and the company who granted the certificate, possibly granting date as well (should be optional)
	- //These are user specific
- //Fix the info in SkillList not always working (for example when returning to the page with a back button from the history page)
