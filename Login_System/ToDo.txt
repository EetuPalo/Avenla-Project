DONE:
- //A Better way to view the progression of skills.
- //Admins should be able to add new accounts from their account. The View exists already, but nothing has been implemented.
- //When trying to access stuff youre not authorized for, the wrong (microsoft template) login page is show.
- //Possibly a way to separate the user's self-assesment from the assesment made by the admin [IMPLEMENTED WITH A SIMPLE STRING VALUE THAT IS DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE]
- //Limit the SkillLevel selection to 0-5
- //User's roles should be edited from the user profile.
