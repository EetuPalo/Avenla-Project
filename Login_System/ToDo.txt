TODO:

- User employment status: Are they an active emoployee at Avenla, are they on holiday, or something else?
- Improve the graphs
- A ton of testing.
- Comments
- Clean up code
- Clean UI

//USERSKILLS
- UserSkills delete function needs to delete the whole form.
- Edit view of userskills should allow the editing of them all on the same form (get the right enties by date and userid)

- Fix the "My Skills" button in the layout
- Add action result messages to all the views
- Maybe change the refresh button in the skillgoals to be automatic instead (needs javascript?)
-WHen registering, remove non letter non number characters so the invalidusername warning is not thrown preventing user from being created

DONE:
- //A Better way to view the progression of skills.
- //Admins should be able to add new accounts from their account. The View exists already, but nothing has been implemented.
- //When trying to access stuff youre not authorized for, the wrong (microsoft template) login page is show.
- //Possibly a way to separate the user's self-assesment from the assesment made by the admin [IMPLEMENTED WITH A SIMPLE STRING VALUE THAT IS DISPLAYED IN THE TABLE]
- //Limit the SkillLevel selection to 0-5
- //User's roles should be edited from the user profile.
- //Fix the SkillLevel 0 not registering
- //Better skill evaluation form (all skills on one form, different forms for different user groups) (Eetu)
- //Creating, editing, setting user groups for admins
- //Authorization fixes
- //Specific SkillLevel goals for each user group. Need to be displayed somehow to the users who are part of that group.
- //Editing skill goals should preserve the old version of the goal. (Similar "view by date" as in userskills)
- //User Groups (Parviz)
- //Remove "change password" from admin (kinda implemented, the code needs refactoring and maybe the whole thing could be more logical)
- //Graphs to display skill progression
- //Fix redirects in edit user (and refactor the whole thing)
- //Admins should edit the forms for each user group (can probably reuse code from user role editing)
- //This could maybe be implemented so that IF skillgoal is set to 0, the user group doesn't need to see it in the userskills form.
