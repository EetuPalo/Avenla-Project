1. Select "Debug" or "Release" from the toolbar.
2. Build -> Build Solution
3. Output console will show the build location once the build is complete. Usually in User/source/repos/etc...
4. Take the wwwroot folder from the project and return it with the build.

SQL

You might need the SQL script if the database needs to be returned as well. 
If you are using localdb, you might want to consider switching to a self hosted SQLEXPRESS. 
You need the SQL Server Management Studio, and you can create a script from there.
You will also need to install SQL Server.
SQL Server Configuration management will be needed for SQL Server.
More info can be found by googling.

HOW TO CREATE A SQL SCRIPT:

Other option is to just return a copy of your localDB, but this might not always work if there are version differences, etc...
